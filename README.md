# NeonTreeEvaluation

Mantainer: Ben Weinstein - University of Florida.

Description: The NeonTreeEvaluation dataset is a set of bounding boxes drawn on RGB imagery from the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). NEON is a set of 45 sites (e.g. [TEAK](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK)) that cover the dominant ecosystems in the US.

# How were images annotated?

Each visible tree was annotated to create a bounding box that encompassed all portions of the vertical object. Fallen trees were not annotated.
